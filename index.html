			  <h2>Biography</h2>
			  <p class="tab">Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in Texas on  October 14, 1890 to parents David Jacob Eisenhower and Ida Elizabeth Stover Eisenhower. His family later moved to Abilene, Kansas. He was the third of seven sons in his family. In 1911, he was appointed to the Unites States Military Academy in West Point. This saddened his mother, who was a Mennonite and a pacifist. After graduating in 1915-as only 64th in his class of 164-he was commisioned as a second lieutenant. While stationed in Texas, Eisenhower met Mamie Doud, and they later married in 1916. They had a child in 1917, who died in 1921, and a child, John Sheldon Doud.</p>
			  <p class="tab">Just before he was supposed to be sent overseas, WWI ended. He soon managed to gain an appointment to the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He graduated the first in his class of 245. He served as a military aide to General John J. Pershing, commander of U.S. forces during World War I. He later served General Douglas MacArthur, U.S. Army chief of staff in the Philippines. Eisenhower was appointed to brigadier general before WWII began. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Eisenhower was called to Washington by the Army's chief of staff, General George C. Marshall, to work as a planning officer. He soon began to get important command assignments. In 1944, he was Supreme Allied Commander of Operation Overlord, the Allied assault on Nazi-occupied Europe. On D-Day, (June 6, 1944) over 150,000 Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, an operation that greatly turned the war in the Allied direction. After just five years, Eisenhower had gone from a lowly lieutenant colonel in the Philippines to commander of the greatest invasion in history. When he came back home in 1945 to serve as chief of staff of the Army, Eisenhower was loved by all of America. Knowing of this popularity, Presidnt Harry Truman proposed that they run together for the democratic presidential candidate, with Truman as the vice president. However, Eisenhower declined. He then became president of Columbia University in 1948 and later, after the Korean War began, the first Supreme Commander of NATO forces in Europe. While in Paris with NATO, Republican diplomats encouraged him to run for president.

	    <div id="election">
	  	  <h2>Election</h2>
	  	  <p class="tab">Eisenhower's first election was in 1952. He was running as a Republican candidate. In the primaries, he was up against a more conservative Senator Robert A. Taft. However, he won the Republican nomination. His running mate was Richard M. Nixon. With the campaign slogan, "I like Ike" he won the election against Adlai Stevenson to become the 34th president of the Unites States.</p>
	  	  <p class="tab">Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in 1955, which raised significant doubt about whether he would be able to run for a second term. However, he made a full recovery, and ran again with Nixon as the Republican candidate in 1956. Once he again, he was against Stevenson, but this time won in a landslide victory.</p>

	    <div id="accomplishments">
	  	  <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
	      <h3> The Korean War</h3>
	  	  <p class="tab">One of Eisenhower's major accomplishments was ending the Korean War. He persuaded the Americans to accept negotiations and the Chinese that if nothing was done, the consequences would be dire. Eisenhower considered this to be his greatest accomplishment as president.</p>
	  	  <h3>The Budget</h3>
	  	  <p class="tab">Eisenhower faced much pressure to cut taxes by his fellows Republicans. However, he focused more on balancing the budget. This was successful. In fact, three of his eight yearly budgets produced a profit for America. </p>
	  	  <h3>Peace</h3>
	  	  <p class="tab">The death of Stalin right after Eisenhower took office greatly changed US-Soviet relations. Despite major Cold War developments throughout Eisenhower's presidency, he always solved each situation calmly. He never let the situation escalate to full-blown war.</p>
	  	  <h3>Highways</h3>
	  	  <p class="tab">Eisenhower signed the Federal Highway Act of 1956. He worked hard to get the bill passed, and when it did, it authorized the construction of the 41,00-mile highway system that we use today.</p>
	    </div>
	    <div id="negatives">
	  	  <h2>Negatives</h2>
	  	  <p class="tab">One of the major failures of the Eisenhower presidency was Eisenhower's failure to publicically denounce Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was claiming that Communist sympathzers held positions in higher government. Eisenhower was worried about Communist spies, but did not agree with McCarthy's tendency to believe someone guilty until proven innocent. Despite these beliefs, Eisenhower did not want to do something that might demaen his work or give McCarthy more publicity. This however, was not the best choice, because he eventually ruined many reputations by his outrageous and unsupported charges. Eisenhower did work behind the scenes to curb McCarthy's power by allowing televisions into his news conferences, therefore diminishing his political power by allowing American audiences to see him in their homes.</p>
	    </div>
	    <div id="post-presidency">
	  	  <h2>Post-Presidency</h2>
	  	  <p class="tab">After his second term was over, in 1960, Eisenhower retired to a farm outside of Gettysburg. He raised cattle, painted, and spent time with his wife, Mamie. He occasionally consulted with President John F Kennedy. His health deteriorated in 1968. After nine months in the hospital he died on March 28, 1969. Eisenhower is remembered today as a president that led America through the Cold War and, while he fell short of some objections, he ultimately made America a stronger country.</p>
